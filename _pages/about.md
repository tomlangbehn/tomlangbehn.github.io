**I am quantitative (marine) ecologist with a strong interest in evolution and global change ecology. I enjoy thinking broadly, to link datawith theory and models, and I find interest in diverse biological disciplines**. Central aspects of my work are foraging interactions, physiology, life-history theory, species distributions, and behavioural ecology. I am particular fascinated by polar (high-latitude) ecosystems and their extreme seasonality, and life in the ocean twilight zone. I work mostly, but not exclusively, on (meso-)pelagic fish,zooplankton, and birds.

**I want to understand the mechanics of life in the ocean**: how species interact, what drives their behaviour, evolutionary strategies, and distributions, and how marine ecosystems across different levels of organisation will respond to perturbations like climate change or fishing.

What I do
======
For my research **I combine numerical models rooted in evolutionary and ecological theory with observations from the field**. Although, most of my work is done from the comforts of my office, I regularly participate in research cruises to collect data in order to ground-truth model predictions. In my work, I often find it useful to think along latitudinal and environmental gradients and use them as natural laboratories.
