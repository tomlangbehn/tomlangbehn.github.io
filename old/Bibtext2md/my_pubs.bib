abstract = {The jellyfish Periphylla periphylla, which can have strong ecological impacts on its environment, is ubiquitous in the Norwegian Sea and its range was predicted to extend northwards. The occurrence of P. periphylla in the northern Barents Sea increased since 2014 and, for the first time, several individuals were collected within a high Arctic fjord ({\textgreater} 78°N) in western Spitsbergen in January 2017. The low solar irradiance prevailing during the polar night and an increased inflow of relatively warm Atlantic water in the European Arctic since the last decade likely provide suitable conditions for the medusa to colonize Svalbard's fjords during the winter months. However, light avoidance constrains the photophobic P. periphylla to deeper offshore areas during the midnight sun period. The current occurrence of P. periphylla in high Arctic fjords during the polar night will have a limited impact on marine ecosystems in the short term, but long-term effects are more uncertain if its abundance continues to increase.},

@article{Kaartvedt2019b,
abstract = {By definition, the mesopelagic twilight zone extends from 200 to 1000 m depth. Rather than confining the twilight zone to a certain depth interval, we here propose a definition that covers absolute light intensities ranging from 10−9 to 10−1 $\mu$mol quanta m−2 s−1. The lowest intensity of this twilight habitat corresponds to the visual threshold of lanternfishes (Myctophidae). The highest intensity corresponds to the upper light exposure of pearlsides (Maurolicus spp.), which have a unique eye adapted to higher light intensities than the lanternfishes. By this definition, the daytime twilight habitat extends deeper than 1000 m in very clear oceanic water, while may even be largely located above 200 m in very murky coastal waters. During moonlit nights in clear water, the twilight habitat would still extend deep into the mesopelagic depth zone, while becoming compressed toward the surface in dark nights. Large variation in night light, from 10−3 $\mu$mol quanta m−2 s−1 during moonlit nights to 10−8 $\mu$mol quanta m−2 s−1 in dark overcast nights, implies that division of light into night- and daylight is insufficient to characterize the habitats and distributional patterns of twilight organisms. Future research will benefit from in situ light measurements, during night- as well as daytime, and habitat classification based on optical properties in addition to depth. We suggest some pertinent research questions for future exploration of the twilight zone.},

@article{Langbehn2019a,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} The authors 2019. Throughout the oceans, small fish and other micronekton migrate between daytime depths of several hundred meters and near-surface waters at night. These diel vertical migrations of mesopelagic organisms structure pelagic ecosystems through trophic interactions, and are a key element in the biological carbon pump. However, depth distributions and migration amplitude vary greatly. Suggested proximate causes of the migration such as oxygen, temperature, and light often correlate and therefore the causal underpinnings have remained unclear. Using mesopelagic fishes and the Norwegian Sea as a study system, we developed a dynamic state variable model that finds optimal migration patterns that we validate with acoustic observations along a latitudinal gradient. The model describes predation risk and bioenergetics, and maximizes expected energy surplus, a proxy for Darwinian fitness. The model allows us to disentangle the drivers of migration and make predictions about depth distribution and related fitness consequences along a latitudinal trajectory with strong gradients in environmental drivers and vertical distribution of scattering layers. We show that the model-predicted vertical migration of mesopelagic fishes matches that observed along this transect. For most situations, modelled mesopelagic fish behaviour can be well described by a light comfort zone near identical to that derived from observations. By selectively keeping light or temperature constant, the model reveals that temperature, in comparison with light, has little effect on depth distribution. We find that water clarity, which limits how deeply light can penetrate into the ocean, structures daytime depths, while surface light at night controlled the depth of nocturnal ascents.},

@article{Langbehn2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright}2017 The Authors. Global Change Biology Published by John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd. Light is a central driver of biological processes and systems. Receding sea ice changes the lightscape of high-latitude oceans and more light will penetrate into the sea. This affects bottom-up control through primary productivity and top-down control through vision-based foraging. We model effects of sea-ice shading on visual search to develop a mechanistic understanding of how climate-driven sea-ice retreat affects predator–prey interactions. We adapt a prey encounter model for ice-covered waters, where prey-detection performance of planktivorous fish depends on the light cycle. We use hindcast sea-ice concentrations (past 35 years) and compare with a future no-ice scenario to project visual range along two south–north transects with different sea-ice distributions and seasonality, one through the Bering Sea and one through the Barents Sea. The transect approach captures the transition from sub-Arctic to Arctic ecosystems and allows for comparison of latitudinal differences between longitudes. We find that past sea-ice retreat has increased visual search at a rate of 2.7{\%} to 4.2{\%} per decade from the long-term mean; and for high latitudes, we predict a 16-fold increase in clearance rate. Top-down control is therefore predicted to intensify. Ecological and evolutionary consequences for polar marine communities and energy flows would follow, possibly also as tipping points and regime shifts. We expect species distributions to track the receding ice-edge, and in particular expect species with large migratory capacity to make foraging forays into high-latitude oceans. However, the extreme seasonality in photoperiod of high-latitude oceans may counteract such shifts and rather act as a zoogeographical filter limiting poleward range expansion. The provided mechanistic insights are relevant for pelagic ecosystems globally, including lakes where shifted distributions are seldom possible but where predator–prey consequences would be much related. As part of the discussion on photoperiodic implications for high-latitude range shifts, we provide a short review of studies linking physical drivers to latitudinal extent.},

abstract = {Collapses and regime changes are pervasive in complex systems (such as marine ecosystems) governed by multiple stressors. The demise of Atlantic cod ( Gadus morhua ) stocks constitutes a text book example of the consequences of overexploiting marine living resources, yet the drivers of these nearly synchronous collapses are still debated. Moreover, it is still unclear why rebuilding of collapsed fish stocks such as cod is often slow or absent. Here, we apply the stochastic cusp model, based on catastrophe theory, and show that collapse and recovery of cod stocks are potentially driven by the specific interaction between exploitation pressure and environmental drivers. Our statistical modelling study demonstrates that for most of the cod stocks, ocean warming could induce a nonlinear discontinuous relationship between fishing pressure and stock size, which would explain hysteresis in their response to reduced exploitation pressure. Our study suggests further that a continuing increase in ocean temperatures will probably limit productivity and hence future fishing opportunities for most cod stocks of the Atlantic Ocean. Moreover, our study contributes to the ongoing discussion on the importance of climate and fishing effects on commercially exploited fish stocks, highlighting the importance of considering discontinuous dynamics in holistic ecosystem-based management approaches, particularly under climate change.},
